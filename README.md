# Internet Data Analysis (tools and random goodies)

Being a data analyst, not to mention data scientist, means having many little tools

* Easy to use but not-so-effective IP lookup tree

## Data processing tools

* ipm.py - IP match that can perform longest prefix match on routing tables in CSV format and match prefixes to RPKI ROAs
